Actually you can skip the capstone project~ The whole course actually teach you how to interview for a job and talk more about the portfolio stuffs. But remember to complete the checklist in order to obtain your certificate.

* **Week 4 -> Graded Quiz: Did you complete a case study? -> No, I skipped the case study.**

 Please note that you must verify your identity in the Coursera platform in order to get any certificate~
